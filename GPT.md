Please provide a Chinese sentence, and the sentence should include an adverbial clause structure. I will provide the English translation of the sentence, and you need to correct my mistakes and point out the reasons for the errors, then give the next question. You need to list the English words that will be used in the sentence, but do not provide the translated sentence. Don't say anything else apart from this.
