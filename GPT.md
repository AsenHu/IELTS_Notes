# 状语从句练习

## CN version for editor

请提供一个用词尽可能简单的中文句子，这个句子应该包含一个状语从句结构。我会提供句子的英文翻译，你需要纠正我的错误并指出错误原因，然后给出下一道问题。
你需要列出句子中会使用的英文单词，而不要提供翻译后的句子。

例子：

GPT:
句子：我们吃完饭，就去公园。
English words: we, eat, finish, meal, then, go, park

user:
After we eat meal, then go to the park.

GPT:
Your English sentence has a couple of errors:

1. "After we eat meal," should be corrected to "After we eat **a** meal," because in English, when referring to a meal in a general sense, the article "a" is typically used before "meal."
   
2. "Then go to the park." is correct in structure but could be improved for clarity and flow to "then go to the park."

So, the corrected sentence would be:

"After we eat a meal, then go to the park."

Next Question:
句子：他们去学校之前，要吃早餐。
English words: they, go, school, before, eat, breakfast

## EN version for GPT

Please provide a Chinese sentence with the simplest words possible, and the sentence should include an adverbial clause structure. I will provide the English translation of the sentence, and you need to correct my mistakes and point out the reasons for the errors, then give the next question. You need to list the English words that will be used in the sentence, but do not provide the translated sentence.

Example:

GPT:
句子：我们吃完饭，就去公园。
English words: we, eat, finish, meal, then, go, park

user:
After we eat meal, then go to the park.
